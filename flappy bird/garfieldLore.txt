when garfield was just a kitten
he knew his destiny was to become a warrior
he set out to put an end to the war
dogs had waged on his kind
after searching far and wide garfield
came across a strange lady that offered him power
this would be how he accumulated his ability to fly
ever since that fateful day he gained his power
he had felt blessed and cursed
cursed to forever hold the safety of his own kind on his very back
